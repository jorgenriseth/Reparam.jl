# Reparam.jl
This repository contains source code for a Riemannian gradient descent algorithm for reparametrization of parametric curves and surfaces. It was created as part of my masters thesis in Industrial Mathemetics at NTNU.

In its current state, the algorithm is not very effective. While I have some ideas as to how to improve it, there are more promising alternatives to solving the registration problem. 

A cleanup of the repository, as well as some guides for example usage will be commited shortly.
